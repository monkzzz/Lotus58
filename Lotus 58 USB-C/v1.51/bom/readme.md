# Interactive BOM
To view the interactive bom, use the html preview link here: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TweetyDaBird/Lotus-58-Classic/blob/release/Lotus%2058%20USB-C/v1.51/bom/ibom.html

**Please note** that the BOM relies on the PCB manufacturing files, and shows the various positions. Because of the dual sided design, some of the quantities for the various parts may need be doubled for a full two handed build, as some parts are counted only once, and some may not need too, as they are possible to position on both sides and counted correctly. This is impossible to correct without making thew files unusable for PCB manufacture, so you you will have to use common sense and first grade math.
